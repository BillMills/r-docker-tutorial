## Installing R Packages

You can install R packages with your RSutudio, like you would on a desktop. The image below shows RStudio server running within a docker image.

### Installing Dependencies external to the R system

Many R packages have dependencies external to R, for example GSL, GDAL, JAGS and so on. To install these on a running rocker container you need to go to the docker command line and type the following:

```{r external-dependencies, eval=FALSE}
#docker ps # find the ID of the running container you want to add a package to
#docker exec -it <container-id> bash # a docker command to start a bash shell in your container
#apt-get install libgsl0-dev # install the package, in this case GSL
```
