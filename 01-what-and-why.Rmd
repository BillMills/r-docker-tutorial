Imagine you are working on an analysis in R and you send your code to a friend. 
Your friend runs exactly this code on exactly the same data set but gets a slightly
different result. This can have various reasons such as a different operating
system, a different version of an R package, etc..
Docker is trying to solve problems like that.

**A Docker image can be seen as a computer inside your computer**. The cool
thing about this virtual computer is that you can send it to your friends; And when
they start this computer and run your code they will get exactly the same results
as you did.

In short, you should use Docker because

- it allows you to wrangle dependencies
- it makes sure that your analyses are reproducible
